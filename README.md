# Amazon Clone Server

The "Amazon Clone Server" project complements the Amazon Clone mobile application by providing the backend and server-side functionalities required for the e-commerce platform. It aims to handle user authentication, product management, cart handling, order processing, and other essential operations to support the seamless functioning of the Amazon Clone app.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication: Implement user registration, login, and password reset functionality to enable secure access to the platform. Use token-based authentication for enhanced security.

2. Product Management: Set up an API endpoint to manage product data, including details like images, prices, descriptions, categories, and reviews. Support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.

3. Cart Management: Handle user shopping carts, allowing users to add and remove items, update quantities, and retrieve the cart state across sessions.

4. Order Processing: Implement APIs to handle order creation, order status tracking, and order history for users.

5. Search Functionality: Set up an API to enable efficient product search based on user queries.

6. User Reviews and Ratings: Allow users to submit reviews and ratings for products they have purchased.

7. User Profiles: Provide endpoints to manage user profile information and preferences.

8. Wishlist: Support APIs for users to add and remove products from their wishlist.

9. Security: Implement secure API endpoints and protect against common security threats, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

10. Payment Integration: If applicable, integrate with payment gateways to handle secure and smooth payment processing for orders.

11. Scalability and Performance: Optimize the server for scalability and performance to handle a potentially large number of users and concurrent requests.

Tech Stack:

- Programming Language: Node.js (JavaScript).
- Web Framework: Express.js (Node.js).
- Database: MongoDB to store product data, user information, orders, and other relevant data.
- Authentication: Use token-based authentication (JWT) to secure user login and API access.
- REST APIs

Challenges:

- Data Modeling: Designing a suitable database schema to efficiently handle product data, user data, and order details.
- API Design: Creating a well-organized and intuitive API structure for easy integration with the frontend application.
- Security: Ensuring secure authentication, authorization, and data protection against potential attacks.
- Scalability: Optimizing the server architecture to handle high traffic and a growing user base.

Overall, the Amazon Clone Server project provides hands-on experience in building the server-side components of an e-commerce platform, equipping developers with essential skills for creating robust, scalable, and secure backend systems.
